    "### Using Built-In Continuous Color Scales\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Plotly Express functions accept a `color_continuous_scale` argument and many trace\n",
    "types have a `colorscale` attribute in their schema. Plotly comes with a large number of\n",
    "built-in continuous color scales, which can be referred to in Python code when setting the above arguments,\n",
    "either by name in a case-insensitive string e.g. `px.scatter(color_continuous_scale=\"Viridis\"`) or by reference e.g.\n",
    "`go.Scatter(marker_colorscale=plotly.colors.sequential.Viridis)`. They can also be reversed by adding `_r` at the end\n",
    "e.g. `\"Viridis_r\"` or `plotly.colors.sequential.Viridis_r`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plotly.colours` module is also available under `plotly.express.colors` so you can refer to it as `px.colors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using continuous color scales, you will often want to [configure various aspects of its range and colorbar](/python/colorscales/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete Color Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly also comes with some built-in [discrete color sequences](/python/discrete-color/) which are _not intended_ to be used with the `color_continuous_scale` argument as they are not designed for interpolation to occur between adjacent colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named Built-In Continuous Color Scales\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any of the following names as string values to set `continuous_color_scale` or `colorscale` arguments.\n",
    "These strings are case-insensitive and you can append `_r` to them to reverse the order of the scale."
