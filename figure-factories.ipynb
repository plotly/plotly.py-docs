    "#### `plotly.figure_factory`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `plotly.figure_factory` module contains dedicated functions for creating very specific types of plots that were at the time of their creation difficult to create with [graph objects](/python/graph-objects/) and prior to the existence of [Plotly Express](/python/plotly-express/). As new functionality gets added to [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) and to Plotly Express, certain Figure Factories become unnecessary and are therefore deprecated as \"legacy\", but remain in the module for backwards-compatibility reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following types of plots are still difficult to create with Graph Objects or Plotly Express and therefore the corresponding Figure Factories are *not* deprecated:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [Dendrograms](/python/dendrogram/)\n",
    "  * [Hexagonal Binning Tile Map](/python/hexbin-mapbox/)\n",

    "\n",
    "Deprecated \"legacy\" Figure Factories include:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * [Annotated Heatmaps](/python/annotated-heatmap/), deprecated by [heatmaps with `px.imshow()`](/python/heatmaps/)\n",
    "  * [County Choropleth Maps](/python/county-choropleth/), deprecated by regular [Choropleth maps with GeoJSON input](/python/choropleth-maps/)\n",
    "  * [Distplots](/python/distplot/), mostly deprecated by [`px.histogram`](/python/histograms/) except for KDE plots, which `px.histogram` doesn't support yet\n",
    "  * [Gantt Charts](/python/gantt/), deprecated by [`px.timeline`](/python/gantt/)\n",
