    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The [`plotly` Python library](/python/) is an interactive, [open-source](/python/is-plotly-free) plotting library that supports over 40 unique chart types covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built on top of the Plotly JavaScript library ([plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/)), `plotly` enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash. The `plotly` Python library is sometimes referred to as \"plotly.py\" to differentiate it from the JavaScript library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to deep integration with our [Kaleido](https://medium.com/plotly/introducing-kaleido-b03c4b7b1d81) image export utility, `plotly` also provides great support for non-web contexts including desktop editors (e.g. QtConsole, Spyder, PyCharm) and static document publishing (e.g. exporting notebooks to PDF with high-quality vector images).\n",
    "\n",
    "This Getting Started guide explains how to install `plotly` and related optional pages. Once you've installed, you can use our documentation in three main ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You jump right in to **examples** of how to make [basic charts](/python/basic-charts/), [statistical charts](/python/statistical-charts/), [scientific charts](/python/scientific-charts/), [financial charts](/python/financial-charts/), [maps](/python/maps/), and [3-dimensional charts](/python/3d-charts/).\n",
    "2. If you prefer to learn about the **fundamentals** of the library first, you can read about [the structure of figures](/python/figure-structure/), [how to create and update figures](/python/creating-and-updating-figures/), [how to display figures](/python/renderers/), [how to theme figures with templates](/python/templates/), [how to export figures to various formats](/python/static-image-export/) and about [Plotly Express, the high-level API](/python/plotly-express/) for doing all of the above.\n",
    "3. You can check out our exhaustive **reference** guides: the [Python API reference](/python-api-reference) or the [Figure Reference](/python/reference)\n",
    "\n",
    "For information on using Python to build web applications containing plotly figures, see the [_Dash User Guide_](https://dash.plotly.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also encourage you to join the [Plotly Community Forum](http://community.plotly.com/) if you want help with anything related to `plotly`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "`plotly` may be installed using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ pip install plotly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "or `conda`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ conda install -c plotly plotly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Plotly Express, install its required dependencies with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install plotly[express]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also need to install a [supported dataframe library](/python/px-arguments#supported-dataFrame-types).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotly charts in Dash\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) is the best way to build analytical apps in Python using Plotly figures. To run the app below, run `pip install dash`, click \"Download\" to get the code and run `python app.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Get started  with [the official Dash docs](https://dash.plotly.com/installation) and **learn how to effortlessly [style](https://plotly.com/dash/design-kit/) & [deploy](https://plotly.com/dash/app-manager/) apps like this with <a class=\"plotly-red\" href=\"https://plotly.com/dash/\">Dash Enterprise</a>.**\n"
