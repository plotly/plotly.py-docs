    "### Overview\n",
    "This section covers the lower-level details of how plotly.py can use orca to perform static image generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "> As of `plotly` version 4.9, Orca is no longer the recommended way to do static image export.  We now recommend Kaleido, as described in the [Static Image Export](/python/static-image-export/) section .\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the [Static Image Export](/python/static-image-export/) section for general information on creating static images from plotly.py figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is orca?\n",
    "Orca is an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application that inputs plotly figure specifications and converts them into static images.  Orca can run as a command-line utility or as a long-running server process. In order to provide the fastest possible image export experience, plotly.py launches orca in server mode, and communicates with it over a local port. See https://github.com/plotly/orca for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, plotly.py launches the orca server process the first time an image export operation is performed, and then leaves it running until the main Python process exits. Because of this, the first image export operation in an interactive session will typically take a couple of seconds, but then all subsequent export operations will be significantly faster, since the server is already running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing orca\n",
    "There are 3 general approaches to installing orca and its Python dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### conda\n",
    "Using the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) package manager, you can install these dependencies in a single command:"

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "id": "801b11f9",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "**Note:** Even if you do not want to use conda to manage your Python dependencies, it is still useful as a cross platform tool for managing native libraries and command-line utilities (e.g. git, wget, graphviz, boost, gcc, nodejs, cairo, etc.).  For this use-case, start with [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (~60MB) and tell the installer to add itself to your system `PATH`.  Then run `conda install plotly-orca==1.2.1` and the orca executable will be available system wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### npm + pip\n",
    "You can use the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) package manager to install `orca` (and its `electron` dependency), and then use pip to install `psutil`:"

For example, if timeout is set to 20, then the orca server will shutdown once is has not been used for at least 20 seconds. If timeout is set to `None` (the default), then the server will not be automatically shut down due to inactivity.\n",

    " - **`default_height`**: The default pixel height to use on image export.\n",
    " - **`default_scale`**: The default image scale factor applied on image export.\n",
    " - **`default_format`**: The default image format used on export. One of `\"png\"`, `\"jpeg\"`, `\"webp\"`, `\"svg\"`, `\"pdf\"`, or `\"eps\"`.\n",
    " - **`mathjax`**: Location of the MathJax bundle needed to render LaTeX characters. Defaults to a CDN location. If fully offline export is required, set this to a local MathJax bundle.\n",

    " - **`mapbox_access_token`**: Mapbox access token required to render `scattermapbox` traces.\n",
    " - **`use_xvfb`**: Whether to call orca using [Xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) on Linux. Xvfb is needed for orca to work in a Linux environment if an X11 display server is not available.  By default, plotly.py will automatically use Xvfb if it is installed, and no active X11 display server is detected.  This can be set to `True` to force the use of Xvfb, or it can be set to `False` to disable the use of Xvfb."
