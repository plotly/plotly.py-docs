    "*New in Plotly.py version 6*\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly Express natively supports various dataframe libraries, including pandas, Polars, and PyArrow. When building figures with Plotly Express, changing your dataframe library may help improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In versions of Plotly.py prior to version 6, Plotly Express functions accepted non-pandas dataframes as input but used the [dataframe interchange protocol](https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/) or converted those dataframes to pandas internally.\n",

    "## NumPy and NumPy Convertible Arrays for Improved Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "*New in Plotly.py version 6*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can improve the performance of generating Plotly figures that use a large number of data points by passing data as NumPy arrays, or in a format that Plotly can convert easily to NumPy arrays, such as pandas and Polars Series or DataFrames. These formats will usually show better performance than passing data as a Python list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly.py uses Plotly.js for rendering, which supports typed arrays. In Plotly.py, NumPy arrays and NumPy-convertible arrays are base64 encoded before being passed to Plotly.js for rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays and Data Types Supported\n",
    "\n",
    "The following types of objects in Python are supported for base64 encoding for rendering with Plotly.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy `numpy.ndarray` objects.\n",
    "- pandas Index, pandas Series, Polars Series, and PyArrow Chunked Array objects.\n",
    "- When working with Plotly Express, pandas DataFrame, Polars DataFrame and PyArrow DataFrame objects passed to the `data_frame` argument of `px` functions.\n",
    "- Array objects that can be converted to `numpy.ndarray` objects, i.e., they implement `\"__array__\"` or `\"__array_interface__\"` and return a `numpy.ndarray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following [array data types](https://numpy.org/devdocs/reference/arrays.scalars.html) are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "- float32\n",

    "- int16\n",
    "- uint16\n",
    "- int32\n",
    "- uint32\n",
    "\n",
    "*If the array dtype is **int64** or **uint64**, often the default dtype for arrays in NumPy when no dtype is specified, those dtypes will be changed to supported types internally by Plotly.py where possible. When working with NumPy directly, you can [also specify the `dtype`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.types.html#array-types-and-conversions-between-types) when creating `ndarray` objects, and Plotly.py won't need to make the conversion internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays or data types that are not supported for base64 encoding to Plotly.js's typed arrays specification will still work and render correctly with Plotly. Those arrays and or data types just won't have the performance benefits that Plotly.js's base64 typed arrays feature provides.\n",

    "## WebGL\n",
    "\n",
    "`plotly` figures are rendered by web browsers, which broadly speaking have two families of capabilities for rendering graphics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The SVG API, which supports vector rendering.\n",
    "- The Canvas API, which supports raster rendering, and can exploit GPU hardware acceleration via a browser technology known as WebGL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `plotly` trace type is rendered with either SVG or WebGL. The following trace types use WebGL for rendering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accelerated versions of SVG trace types: `scattergl`, `scatterpolargl`,\n",
    "* High-performance multidimensional trace types: `splom`, or `parcoords`\n",
    "* 3D trace types `scatter3d`, `surface`, `mesh3d`, `cone`, `streamtube`, `isosurface`, `volume`\n",
    "* Mapbox Gl JS-powered trace types: `scattermap`, `choroplethmap`, `densitymap`\n",
    "\n",
    "### WebGL Limitations and Tradeoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "WebGL is a powerful technology for accelerating rendering but comes with some strict limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. GPU requirement: WebGL is a GPU (graphics card) technology and therefore requires specific hardware which is available in most but not all cases and is supported by most but not all browsers.\n",
    "2. Rasterization: WebGL-rendered data is drawn as a grid of pixels rather than as individual shapes, so can appear pixelated or fuzz in certain cases, and when exported to static file formats will appear pixelated on zoom. In addition, text rendering will differ between SVG and WebGL-powered traces.\n",
    "3. Context limits: browsers impose a strict limit on the number of WebGL \"contexts\" that any given web document can access. WebGL-powered traces in `plotly` can use multiple contexts in some cases but as a general rule, **it may not be possible to render more than 8 WebGL-involving figures on the same page at the same time.** See the following section, Multiple WebGL Contexts, for more details.\n",
    "4. Size limits: browsers impose hardware-dependent limits on the height and width of figures using WebGL which users may encounter with extremely large plots (e.g. tens of thousands of pixels of height).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above limitations, the WebGL-powered version of certain SVG-powered trace types (`scattergl`, `scatterpolargl`) are not complete drop-in replacements for their SVG counterparts yet\n",
    "* Available symbols will differ.\n",
    "* Area fills are not yet supported in WebGL.\n",
    "* Range breaks on time-series axes are not yet supported.\n",
    "* Axis range heuristics may differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple WebGL Contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "*New in 5.19*\n",
    "\n",
    "Most browsers have a limit of between 8 and 16 WebGL contexts per page. A Plotly WebGL-based figure may use multiple WebGL contexts, but generally you'll be able to render between 4 and 8 figures on one page.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you exceed the browser limit on WebGL contexts, some figures won't render and you'll see an error. In the console in Chrome, for example, you'll see the error: \"Too many active WebGL contexts. Oldest context will be lost\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter WebGL context limits when using WebGL-based figures, you can use [Virtual WebGL](https://github.com/greggman/virtual-webgl), which virtualizes a single WebGL context into multiple contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, in the environment where your Plotly figures are being rendered, load the Virtual WebGL script, \"https://unpkg.com/virtual-webgl@1.0.6/src/virtual-webgl.js\", for example, using a `<script>` tag. Performance when using Virtual WebGL will be slower than when not using Virtual WebGL.\n",
