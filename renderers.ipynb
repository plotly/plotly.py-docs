    "# Displaying Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotly's Python graphing library, `plotly.py`, gives you a wide range of options for how and where to display your figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there are five different approaches you can take in order to display `plotly` figures:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Using the `renderers` framework in the context of a script or notebook (the main topic of this page)\n",
    " 2. Using [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly) in a web app context\n",
    " 3. Using a [`FigureWidget` rather than a `Figure`](https://plotly.com/python/figurewidget/) in an [`ipywidgets` context](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n",
    " 4. By [exporting to an HTML file](https://plotly.com/python/interactive-html-export/) and loading that file in a browser immediately or later\n",
    " 5. By [rendering the figure to a static image file using Kaleido](https://plotly.com/python/static-image-export/) such as PNG, JPEG, SVG, PDF or EPS and loading the resulting file in any viewer\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the first three approaches is discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Figures Using The `renderers` Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The renderers framework is a flexible approach for displaying `plotly.py` figures in a variety of contexts.  To display a figure using the renderers framework, you call the `.show()` method on a graph object figure, or pass the figure to the `plotly.io.show` function. With either approach, `plotly.py` will display the figure using the current default renderer(s)."

    "\n",
    "This renderer is a good choice for notebooks that will be exported to HTML files (Either using [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or the \"Download as HTML\" menu action) because the exported HTML files will work without an Internet connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: Adding the plotly.js bundle to the notebook adds a few megabytes to the notebook size. If you can count on always having an Internet connection, you may want to consider using the `notebook_connected` renderer if notebook size is a constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `notebook_connected`\n",
    "This renderer is the same as `notebook` renderer, except the plotly.js JavaScript library bundle is loaded from an online CDN location.  This saves a few megabytes in notebook size, but an Internet connection is required in order to display figures that are rendered this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This renderer is a good choice for notebooks that will be shared with [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) since users must have an active Internet connection to access nbviewer in the first place.\n",

    "###### `kaggle` and `azure`\n",

    "This is a custom renderer for use with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",

    "###### `browser`\n",
    "This renderer will open a figure in a browser tab using the default web browser.  This renderer can only be used when the Python kernel is running locally on the same machine as the web browser, so it is not compatible with Jupyter Hub or online notebook services.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Implementation Note 1: In this context, the \"default browser\" is the browser that is chosen by the Python [`webbrowser`](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/webbrowser.html) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Implementation Note 2: The `browser` renderer works by setting up a single use local webserver on a local port. Since the webserver is shut down as soon as the figure is served to the browser, the figure will not be restored if the browser is refreshed.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `firefox`, `chrome`, and `chromium`\n",
    "These renderers are the same as the `browser` renderer, but they force the use of a particular browser.\n",

    "These renderers write figures out as standalone HTML files and then display [`iframe`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_iframe.asp) elements that reference these HTML files. The `iframe` renderer will include the plotly.js JavaScript bundle in each HTML file that is written, while the `iframe_connected` renderer includes only a reference to an online CDN location from which to load plotly.js.  Consequently, the `iframe_connected` renderer outputs files that are smaller than the `iframe` renderer, but it requires an Internet connection while the `iframe` renderer can operate offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This renderer may be useful when working with notebooks than contain lots of large figures.  When using the `notebook` or `notebook_connected` renderer, all of the data for all of the figures in a notebook are stored inline in the notebook itself. If this would result in a prohibitively large notebook size, an `iframe` or `iframe_connected` renderer could be used instead. With the `iframe` renderers, the figure data are stored in the individual HTML files rather than in the notebook itself, resulting in a smaller notebook size.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Implementation Note: The HTML files written by the `iframe` renderers are stored in a subdirectory named `iframe_figures`.  The HTML files are given names based on the execution number of the notebook cell that produced the figure. This means that each time a notebook kernel is restarted, any prior HTML files will be overwritten.  This also means that you should not store multiple notebooks using an `iframe` renderer in the same directory, because this could result in figures from one notebook overwriting figures from another notebook."
