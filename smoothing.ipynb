    "#### Savitzky-Golay Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "`Smoothing` is a technique that is used to eliminate noise from a dataset. There are many algorithms and methods to accomplish this but all have the same general purpose of 'roughing out the edges' or 'smoothing' some data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is reason to smooth data if there is little to no small-scale structure in the data. The danger to this thinking is that one may skew the representation of the data enough to change its perceived meaning, so for the sake of scientific honesty it is an imperative to at the very minimum explain one's reason's for using a smoothing algorithm to their dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use the [Savitzky-Golay Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_filter), which fits subsequent windows of adjacent data with a low-order polynomial."
