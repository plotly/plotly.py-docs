    "\n",
    "> Note on terminology: Theming generally refers to the process of defining default styles for visual elements. Themes in plotly are implemented using objects called templates. Templates are slightly more general than traditional themes because in addition to defining default styles, templates can pre-populate a figure with visual elements like annotations, shapes, images, and more. In the documentation we will refer to the overall process of defining default styles as theming, and when in comes to the plotly API we will talk about how themes are implemented using templates.\n",
